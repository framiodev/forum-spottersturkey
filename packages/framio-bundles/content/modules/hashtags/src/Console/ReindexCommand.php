/**
 * Backfill hashtags from posts written before this extension was installed.
 *
 * Why this is needed at all: Flarum stores posts as PARSED XML. A post written
 * before the extension existed has `#gameday` sitting in a text node, not a
 * HASHTAG element — so it neither renders as a link nor appears in any feed,
 * however many times the page is reloaded. Only re-parsing fixes that, and
 * re-parsing is what Flarum itself does whenever a post is edited.
 *
 * The risk being managed here is that unparse → parse is a round trip through
 * every OTHER formatter extension too. So this command touches as few posts as
 * possible:
 *
 *   1. SQL pre-filter: only posts whose content contains a `#` at all.
 *   2. Regex pre-filter on the unparsed source: only posts where the hashtag
 *      pattern actually matches.
 *
 * On a typical forum that leaves single-digit percentages of posts rewritten.
 * Everything else is read and skipped without ever being written back.
