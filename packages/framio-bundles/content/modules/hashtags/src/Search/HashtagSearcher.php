 * Backs `GET /api/hashtags` (autocomplete + the browse page).
 *
 * No whereVisibleTo: a hashtag row is a word, not content. What a hashtag
 * leads to is scoped per-actor by the discussion search itself (see
 * HashtagFilter), so a hashtag only used in a private discussion appears in
 * the list but its feed comes back empty for anyone who cannot see it.
 *
 * That is a deliberate trade: it leaks the existence of a word, not of a
 * discussion, a title, or an author.
