/**
 * Correct hashtag totals after a post is hard-deleted.
 *
 * Separate from SyncHashtagsOnPostSave, and not queued, for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. Extend\Event::listen() types its listener `callable|string`, and
 *     [Class::class, 'method'] is NOT callable for an instance method — so a
 *     second handler on the same class cannot be registered. One event, one
 *     listener class.
 *  2. The pivot rows are already gone (FK cascade) by the time this fires. The
 *     only remaining record of which hashtags the post used is the model held
 *     in the event, which cannot survive serialisation into a job.
